== keyboard-anywhere

A virtual musical keyboard using the XBox Kinect, written in python and based 
on libfreenect.

Since releasing the video, we've had a lot of requests for code. I have 
held off until this point, because the dependencies are quite complex, and
getting the code running is probably more trouble than it's worth. Still,
at least now you can read the code and see how we did it.

NOTE: I have no intention of making an active project out of this. This 
repository has been created to distribute the source code used in the demo 
video, along with some basic information about setup and usage. Hopefully
it will be sufficient for other uses to be able to run keyboard-anywhere
on their own computer. If not, then hopefully the code will be useful for
people developing for the Kinect. The code may be further developed and 
features added, but I make no guarantees.

== Basic Instructions

So far, I've only attempted to make this work on GNU/Linux (or more 
specifically, Ubuntu 10.04 and 10.10). All instructions assume you have
a recent Ubuntu install. Mac or Windows users might be able to get it
working, but you're on your own as far as dependencies are concerned.

=== Dependencies

The python script depends on:
- freenect
- numpy
- pyopengl
- PyQt4
- PyQGLViewer
- fluidsynth


If you have all of them working in python, you're good to go. Otherwise
skip to the "Detailed Instructions" section below.

=== Usage

== Detailed Instructions

I got keyboard-anywhere working on a fresh Ubuntu 10.10 install with the
following steps (hopefully I didn't leave any out).

1.  apt-get install the following (this is AFAIK the minimal set):
    (to get PyQGLViewer / PyQt4 working)
    - build-essential
    - pyqt4-devtools
    - qt4-qmake
    - libqt4-dev
    - python-qt4-gl
    - python-qt4-dev
    - python-numpy
    - python-setuptools

    (to get freenect working)
    - cmake
    - libusb-1.0-0-dev
    - freeglut3-dev
    - libxmu-dev
    - libxi-dev

    (for audio output)
    - fluidsynth
    - fluid-soundfont-gm

2.  use easy_install to get cython 0.14
    - sudo easy_install cython

3.  compile libfreenect (with BUILD_PYTHON set to ON)
    (follow the instructions at https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect)

4.  download, compile and install QGLViewer and PyQGLViewer (follow instructions in the 
    INSTALL or README files)
